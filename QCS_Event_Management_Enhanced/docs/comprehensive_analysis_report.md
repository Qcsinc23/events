## Critical Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Authentication System Failure (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** Custom password hashing function only supported pbkdf2 format, but admin account used bcrypt format.
- **Impact:** Complete login failure for admin users
- **Root Cause:** Incomplete password hash checking implementation
- **Solution:** Enhanced `check_password_hash()` function to support both bcrypt and pbkdf2 formats
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 2. Blueprint Registration Conflicts (HIGH)
**Issue:** Blueprints registered with conflicting URL prefixes causing 404 errors.
- **Impact:** Calendar, locations, and tasks pages inaccessible
- **Root Cause:** Incorrect URL prefix configuration in `app.py`
- **Solution:** Removed conflicting URL prefixes from blueprint registration
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 3. Template Syntax Error (MEDIUM)
**Issue:** `locations.html` template missing closing `{% endblock %}` tag.
- **Impact:** Jinja template rendering failures
- **Root Cause:** Incomplete template file
- **Solution:** Completed template with proper form structure and closing tags
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 4. Corrupted Password Hash (MEDIUM)
**Issue:** Admin user had truncated bcrypt hash in database.
- **Impact:** Admin login impossible despite correct password
- **Root Cause:** Database corruption or import error
- **Solution:** Regenerated admin password hash using application's hashing function
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 5. URL Routing Conflicts (LOW)
**Issue:** Template references to blueprint endpoints incorrect.
- **Impact:** Form submission failures
- **Root Cause:** Incorrect `url_for()` endpoint references
- **Solution:** Updated template references to use proper blueprint namespacing
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Security Headers
- **X-Content-Type-Options:** nosniff
